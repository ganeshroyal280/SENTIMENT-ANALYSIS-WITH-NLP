Title: Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

**Abstract:**
This implementation demonstrates a practical approach to performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews using machine learning techniques. A simple dataset of ten sample reviews is used to train a logistic regression model through TF-IDF vectorization, enabling text classification into positive and negative sentiments.

**Outcome:**
The key outcomes of this implementation are:
1. A trained logistic regression model that classifies text data into positive or negative sentiments.
2. Evaluation metrics including a classification report and accuracy score, providing insights into the modelâ€™s performance.
3. Demonstration of practical predictions on new user-provided text inputs.

**Use Case:**
Sentiment analysis is widely applicable in various fields such as:
- Monitoring social media trends and public opinions.
- Enhancing customer experience by analyzing reviews.
- Detecting user sentiment in chatbot conversations.
This code provides a simple framework for such tasks.

**Language and Platform:**
- **Language:** Python (Scikit-learn for machine learning, Pandas for data handling, and Numpy for numerical computations)
- **Platform:** The code can be executed on Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, or any Python-compatible environment.I executed in Google Colab.

**Description:**
1. **Dataset Preparation:** A sample dataset of ten customer reviews is created with associated sentiments (positive or negative).
2. **Data Splitting:** The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using an 80:20 split.
3. **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Text data is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization, capturing term importance in the context of documents.
4. **Model Building:** Logistic regression, a simple yet effective classification model, is trained on the vectorized data.
5. **Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the test set using accuracy scores and a classification report to assess precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Prediction Demonstration:** The model is tested with new user-provided text inputs to demonstrate real-world applicability.

**Conclusion:**
This code provides a beginner-friendly implementation of sentiment analysis using logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization. It highlights the effectiveness of combining simple models with feature extraction techniques for text classification tasks. The modular structure allows easy adaptation for larger datasets and real-world applications.
